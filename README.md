## a. What is amqp? 
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The protocol enables communication between application layers by sending messages between them, regardless of the programming language or platform used. 

## b. What does `guest:guest@localhost:5672` mean?
The first `guest` refers to the username used to authenticate with the message broker, while the second `guest` is the password associated with the username. `localhost:5672` shows the port number that AMQP uses for non-secure connections (5672) and the hostname of the machine where the message broker is being ran (locally).
